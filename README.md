Deadman is a reminder app that aims to up the stakes, for those whom normal reminders don't seem to work for. It lets you set deadlines for tasks, with punishments if you don't complete them within that time. The app gets its name from a deadman switch, in that it's rigged to go off unless you disarm it. Hopefully this will incentivize swift action from otherwise unmotivated users.
